<p id="no1">Approximately 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year;<br> on average 3,700 people lose their lives every day on the roads. An additional 20-50 million suffer non-fatal injuries,<br> often resulting in long-term disabilities.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="head"> 1: Drinking and Driving</h3>
<br>
<p id="no2">Drunk driving may be a habit of yours but not because you can,<br>  doesn’t mean you will. It is a serious crime in which<br>  most are willing to risk because driving is more convenient  than taking a cab.<br>  You may not be caught drunk driving but know that you are not just compromising your safety but <br> the safety of other people too.

    <br>     When you are under the influence of alcohol, <br> yoursenses are not as effective as it is when you’re sober that’s<br>  why drunk driving is highly discouraged. </p>
     <br>
    <h3 id="head1">2: Overspeeding</h3><p>Living in a fast-paced era, people want to get to where they are supposed to be in the fastest way<br> possible. This is common for people who are running late or when the roads are free<br> from traffic. Overspeeding is the primary cause of a vehicle collision especially in highways.<br> Regardless of how fast or slow your speed is, you will reach your destination.<br>

        It is very tempting to drive at high speed but consider the consequences of what you think is convenient for you.<br> Drive at an acceptable speed which you think is manageable. As much as possible,<br> prevent switching from lane to lane and driving past other cars at a fast pace.<br></p>
    
   <h3 id="head2">3: BEATING THE REDLIGHT</h3><p>Stoplights are designed to engineer different traffic conditions. <br>This way, the flow of traffic is manageable and doesn’t seem too congested.<br> When the traffic lights turn yellow or orange, slow down immediately and<br> prepare for a stop. Don’t beat the red light because apart from the fact that it is a violation,<br> it can also cause a vehicular collision.</p>
